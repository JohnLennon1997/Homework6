The first thing we have to do is recurse the equation T'(n) = 1 + T(n-2) a
few times. This gives us:
T'(n) = 1 + T(n-2) = 1 + (1 + T(n-4)) = 1 + (1 + (1 + T(n-6))) etc.

So we can say that T'(n) = k + T(n-2k).  From there we can set 2k = n and
derive T'(n) = n/2 + T(n-n) = n/2 + T(0) = n/2

So T'(n) = n/2
